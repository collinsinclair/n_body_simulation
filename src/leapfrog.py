    """
    Evolve particles in time via leap-frog integrator scheme. This function
    takes masses, positions, velocities, and a time step dt as

    Parameters
    ----------
    masses : np.ndarray
        1-D array containing masses for all particles, in kg
        It has length N, where N is the number of particles.
    positions : np.ndarray
        2-D array containing (x, y, z) positions for all particles.
        Shape is (N, 3) where N is the number of particles.
    velocities : np.ndarray
        2-D array containing (x, y, z) velocities for all particles.
        Shape is (N, 3) where N is the number of particles.
    dt : float
        Evolve system for time dt (in seconds).

    Returns
    -------
    Updated particle positions and particle velocities, each being a 2-D
    array with shape (N, 3), where N is the number of particles.
