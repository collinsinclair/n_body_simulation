def calculateTrajectories(masses, positions, velocities, duration, dt):
    
    """
    Evolves particle's positions velocities in time.
    Starts from initial positions and velocities, takes a step forward in time,
    calculates new positions and velocities, stores these new values in arrays,
    and then repeat that process over and over again.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    masses: 1D array, with nParticles elements
    positions: 2D array, nParticles × nDimensions elements
    velocities: 2D array, nParticles × nDimensions elements
    duration: the total time to evolve the system (a float, in seconds)
    dt: the size of each time step, (a float, in seconds)
    
    Returns
    -------
    times: 1D array, with nTimes elements
    positions at all times: 3D array, nParticles × nDimensions × nTimes
    velocities at all times: 3D array, nParticles × nDimensions × nTimes
