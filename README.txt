The .txt files contain initial conditions (masses, positions, velocities) for multiple different systems.

The systems.py file contains functions that were used to create these. For some of the systems, you may want to change the parameters that were used to create them. Feel free to use the functions in systems.py to make other initial condition datasets, or modify them in any way you see fit.

Good luck!
